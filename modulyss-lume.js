            'Lume is a multi-level loop pile carpet tile designed to draw the eye. Its textured construction and layered pattern create natural shifts in colour across the floor. Each tile blends multiple yarn tones, producing a soft, iridescent effect that adds depth, tactility and gentle movement to any space. Made from low-carbon Thrive® matter recycled nylon and backed by ecoBACK PLUS, Lume delivers striking visual impact with a reduced environmental footprint. It’s also Cradle to Cradle Certified® Silver under version 4.0, reflecting our ongoing commitment to circular design and material health.',
