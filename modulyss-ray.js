            'Ray is a multi-level loop pile carpet tile with a linear, dotted organic pattern that flows naturally across the floor. Tonal gradients blend seamlessly, creating soft movement and a visual rhythm that enhances the way people experience a space. Ideal for guiding flow, defining zones or supporting wayfinding in dynamic environments. Crafted from low-carbon Thrive® matter recycled nylon and backed by ecoBACK PLUS, Ray combines design direction with a smaller environmental footprint. It’s also Cradle to Cradle Certified® Silver under version 4.0, reflecting our ongoing commitment to circular design and material health.',
